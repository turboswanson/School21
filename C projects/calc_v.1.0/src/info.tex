\section{Introduction}
Poor-quality calculator. Looks bad. Works bad as well. At least it manages to launch.

\section{General info}
The program implements an engineering version of a calculator using Dijkstra's algorithm. 
It converts every expression into postfix notation and then performs calculation.
Smart\_Calc can plot function graphs in a new window with coordinate axis.

\subsection{Usage}
Click the button with a specific label to input the calculating expression in infix notation into the input window. 
If a mistake occurs, click 'CE' button to clear the input. If calculating expression is done click '=' to see the result.
If calculating expression involves 'x', its value can be entered into the specific window. To view the function chart click the 'GRAPH' button.
If errors exist in the input you'll see ERROR after clicking '=' button. To ensure correct results enclose each negative number within brackets.
If divisor is a negative number use additional brackets.

\section{Conclusion}
Makefile contains all, calc, install, uninstall, dist, dvi, test, clean targets. Use any of them for a specific purpose. Don't forget to edit 
\$(INSTALL\_PATH) Makefile variable before make install if you want.
